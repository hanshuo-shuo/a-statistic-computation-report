Latex code included and the outlook is shown in the report named 'Final'.
Also I have divided the whole code into different parts where each part serves as different uses.
LSTM, also named'Long Short-Term Memory', is a kind of neutrol network with long and short term memory.
Since its first established by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997, together with the thrive of deep-learing in 2012 and lots of
experts devoted to it(Felix Gers, Fred Cummins, Santiago Fernandez, Justin Bayer,Daan Wierstra, Julian Togelius, Faustino Gomez, Matteo Gagliolo, and Alex Gloves)
Thus stable and useable LSTM modle formed and had been applied in many fields, especially performing well in time series.
So when it comes to predicting the price in the stock prices, LSTM network is a great choice.
